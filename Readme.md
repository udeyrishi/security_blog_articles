Security Blog Articles
----------------------

This repository contains blog articles analysing some of the current events in the field of computer security. These articles were written as part of the course "ECE 422: Reliable and Secure Systems Design" at the University of Alberta.

Note that these articles are my personal thoughts on these events, and the opinions here do not represent those of the organisations in discussion or the original journalists.
