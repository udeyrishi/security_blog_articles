<h1>Hyatt completes investigation of payment card information theft</h1>

<p>In December, 2015 Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced identifying a malware in their payment processing computers at multiple Hyatt and affiliated locations. They have recently completed the investigation, and confirmed that their customer payment info was indeed exposed to the malware, and was potentially compromised. News sources have linked this to the highly sophisticated malware, ModPOS, previously reported by the security firm iSIGHT Partners.</p>

<p>Hyatt first <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.hyatt.com/news-releases?item=123450">informed</a> the presence of the malware in late December, and warned customers to keep an eye on their payment card statements. An <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.hyatt.com/news-releases?item=123453">update</a> to that press release confirmed that the "investigation identified signs of unauthorized access to payment card data from cards used onsite at certain Hyatt-managed locations ... between August 13, 2015 and December 8, 2015," though it could've been as early as July 30, 2015. They also said that the malware was designed to collect payment card data (cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code) from their payment processing systems. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyatt-hotels-hacking-idUSKBN0U704320151225">Reuters</a>, Hyatt employed <a target="_blank" href="http://fireeye.com">FireEye Inc.</a> to help investigate the attack, and Hyatt claims that the third-party has helped them improve the security of their systems. The details of the malware itself, and how their systems were infected, are not yet officially shared.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, Hilton, Starwood, and Trump hotels also encountered similar infections last year. Reuters suspects that the culprit could have been the "new strain of payment-card stealing malware" <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isightpartners.com/2015/11/modpos/">ModPOS</a> in all these cases, which was discovered and reported by the security firm iSIGHT Partners last November. The firm warned merchants about the malware, which is capable of evading almost all current security software. ModPOS (Modular Point-Of-Sale) malware uses multiple information retrieval techniques, including RAM scraping, that could potentially render <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> protection techniques useless, if the data is kept locally as unencrypted plain text. Maria Naboa, iSIGHT's senior threat analyst, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3008456/data-breach/retailers-targeted-by-sophisticated-modpos-malware.html">described</a> the complexity of the malware "astronomical", and that it is has been specifically designed to be difficult to detect. Interestingly, the Hyatt contracted security firm FireEye <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fireeye.com/company/press-releases/2016/01/fireeye-announces-acquisition-of-global-threat-intelligence-lead.html">acquired iSIGHT</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>Hyatt has created a list of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hyatt.com/protectingourcustomers/hotellist/">affected locations</a>, and is urging customers who visited Hyatt in the affected period to check if their location is in the list. Additionally, they also notified the law enforcement and  payment card networks regarding this breach, and are requesting the affected customers to be vigilant in reviewing their payment card statements. I think that Hyatt did a good speedy job in reacting to this data breach to minimize the impact. However, unless more retailers become proactive in ensuring that their systems are safe against such attacks, it is likely that similar incidents may repeat.
