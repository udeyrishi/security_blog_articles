<p>IoT is a very interesting topic, because whether we accept it or not, these devices are soon going to take over every aspect of our lives. This year's CES was a testimony to that, especially with the events such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10730296/samsung-lg-fridges-ces-2016">Samsung and LG presentations</a>. But as everyone mentioned above, there needs to be some serious attention paid to the security aspect of these devices as they slowly become mainstream.</p>

<p>I agree that the biggest cause of this issue is that the users are largely unaware of the consequences of a security vulnerability in these devices. Out of curiosity, I did a (totally non-scientific and completely random) verbal survey with a few friends, and asked them to describe the process that they would use when buying a smart thermostat for their homes. Most of the responses revolved around their ease of use, functionality/features, and the brand reputation. Not a lot of focus was put on the security aspect. Many of them were unaware that a lack of complete security in these devices could potentially lead to an actual physical burglary--a trend in thermostat readings in a day would correlate heavily with the patterns of presence of individuals at home, helping a burglar narrow down the best times to make a move. Unencrypted communication of people's addresses and their thermostat settings by a "smart device" could have very serious consequences. Although I realize that the sample size for such an experiment needs to be bigger, I would be very surprised if more people didn't share this mindset.</p>

<p>The current state of these devices isn't really helping diss such arguments either. A recent <a target="_blank" href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/feamster/who-will-secure-the-internet-of-things/">study</a> conducted by researchers at Princeton University revealed that many of the products by popular IoT manufacturers "fail to encrypt at least some of the traffic that they send and receive." The study showed how easily they were able to get unencrypted information like the user's zip codes, sensor readings, voice chats, and more over unencrypted HTTP and FTP channels. This is really concerning, because the test devices' list includes manufacturers like Nest (by Google), Belkin, Smartthings (by Samsung), and more--brands that people seem to rely on just because of their names.</p>

<p>I personally also believe that a big reason consumers are ignorant about these potential consequences is that there haven't been any major crimes/incidents so far (at least to receive significant attention) that were caused by security failures in IoT devices targetting homes. But just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't. As the sheer number of these devices explodes, the potential return that a malicious party can expect from such attacks will increase, incentivising them to target these vulnerabilities. Before that happens, standards need to be designed and implemented with strict regulation.</p>
